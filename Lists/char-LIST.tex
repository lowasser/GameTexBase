%% This file sets up the Char, PC, NPC, and Name datatypes and creates
%% macros for each.  These are for characters in the game.  Here you
%% use the fields in Char to assign elements to each character.
%%
%%
%%
%% \MYname (and the player name) is parsed by \parsename, the command
%% provided by LaTeX/parsename.sty.  See that file and
%% Extras/README-namemappings for ways to take advantage of this.
%%
%% \badgetrue and \badgefalse toggle whether or not a Char macro will
%% produce a namebadge.
%%
%% \statstrue and \statsfalse will toggle the statcard.
%%
%% \skillstrue and \skillsfalse will toggle the skill list.  The skill
%% list prints both skills and stats (even if \statsfalse is set).
%%
%% \sheettrue and \sheetfalse will toggle the character sheet.
%%
%% \listtrue and \listfalse toggle whether the Char macro can display
%% in the playerlist.
%%
%% \labeltrue and \labelfalse toggle the box label.
%%
%%
%%
%% Some of the Char datatype's setup is in LaTeX/gametex.sty, to keep
%% this file short.

%% Gender
%%
%% The term 'gender' specifically in GameTeX is used to refer to the
%% pronoun and gendered language used to actually refer to a character.
%% To add a new neopronoun, add a new element to this list
%% with the appropriate next number.

\def\femmegender{1}
\def\theygender{2}
\def\zegender{3}
\def\faegender{4}

\def\eygender{6}
\def\itgender{7}

%% Here, we define 'pronoun sets,' which have two components:
%% which gender is used to always refer to that character in a sentence,
%% and the text used when we introduce that character's pronouns.
%% This does not cover all combinations, but it's easy to add more.
